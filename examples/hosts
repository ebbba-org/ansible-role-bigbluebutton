# To connect using a specific user (and elevate to root with sudo later),
# add `ansible_user=<your user>` next to <your domain> below.
#
# For improved Ansible performance, consider enabling SSH pipelining in your `ansible.cfg` by adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining: True`.
# Beware that this might cause SSH connection troubles. If so, disable it by removing the line in `ansible.cfg`, or adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining=False`
# to a specific host's line below or by adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining: False` to its variables file.
#
# If you're running this Ansible playbook on the same server as the one you're installing to,
# consider adding an additional `ansible_connection=local` argument to the host line below.
#
# Ansible may fail to discover which Python interpreter to use on the host.
# You may sometimes need to explicitly add the argument `ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3`
# to the host line below.
